!C  VARIABLE DEFINITIONS:
!C----------
!C     CRNDIA = CROWN DIAMETER OF SNAG AT TIME OF DEATH
!C     CRNRTO = CROWN RATIO OF SNAG AT TIME OF DEATH
!C     CWDDIA = DIAMETER OF THE CWD OBJECT (ZERO IF UNUSED)
!C     CWDDIR = ORIENTATION OF THE CWD OBJECT
!C     CWDLEN = LENGTH OF THE CWD OBJECT
!C     CWDPIL = PILED(1)/UNPILED(0) STATUS OF THE CWD OBJECT
!C     CWDWT  = WEIGHT (TONS) OF CWD OBJECT
!C    FALLDIR = A VECTOR TO DETERMINE IF A SNAG IS STANDING
!C              0-360 = DIRECTION OF FALL
!C              -1    = THE SNAG IS STANDING
!C     HRATE  = THE RATE MODIFIER FOR HEIGHT LOSS
!C     ILYEAR = THE LAST YEAR ALL SNAGS WAS CALLED
!C     ISNSP  = SPECIES CODE FOR SNAG
!C    ISTATUS = STATUS OF THE SNAG
!C              (IF NEGATIVE, INDICATES THAT SNAG IS TO BE SALVAGED,
!C               AND IS REMOVED IN THE NEXT CALL TO SVOUT)
!C              0 = OPEN SLOT (NO SNAG)
!C              1 = GREEN, HARD SNAG
!C              2 = RED, HARD SNAG
!C              3 = GREY, HARD SNAG
!C              4 = GREY, SOFT SNAG
!C              5 = BLACK, RECENTLY BURNED, STILL HAS CROWN
!C              6 = BLACK, OLDER BURNED, NO CROWN
!C             90 = WWPB MORTALITY, ONE OR LESS YEARS OLD (RED)
!C             91 = WWPB MORTALITY, TWO YEARS OLD (DARK)
!C             92 = WWPB MORTALITY, 3-4 YEARS OLD (GREY)
!C     IYRCOD = THE YEAR OF DEATH
!C     NCWD   = THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CWD RECORDS, FOR SVS
!C     NDEAD  = THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SNAGS
!C     ODIA   = ORIGINAL TREE DIAMETER
!C     OIDTRE = Original IDTREE identifier that generated snag record
!C     OLEN   = ORIGINAL TREE LENGTH
!C     PBFALL = Post-burn fall rate
!C    SNGCNWT = SNAG CROWN WEIGHT BY SIZE CLASS (NOT ALL
!C              CLASSES ARE STORED): 0 : Foliage, 1 : <0.25
!C              2 :  0.25 - 1, AND 3 : 1 - 3. THESE VALUES
!C              ARE AS OF THE YEAR THE SNAG WAS BORN UNLESS
!C              THAT YEAR IS PRIOR TO THE INVENTORY YEAR.
!C     SNGDIA = Current snag diameter.
!C     SNGLEN = Current snag heights (lengths).
!C     SPROBS = Trees/ac snag stockings:
!C              SPROBS(I,1): snag recs, for original source tree rec and
!C                           year of death, created at time of mortality.
!C              SPROBS(I,2): snag recs, for original source tree rec and
!C                           year of death, that are still standing.
!C              SPROBS(I,3): expected snag/acre count for current snag
!C                           record, if fractional fall probabilities
!C                           were applied each year since death (as opposed
!C                           to actual stochastic fall prediction)
!C     YHFHTH = NUMBER OF YEARS AT WHICH HALF THE INITIAL
!C              HEIGHT HAS BEEN LOST, FOR HARD SNAGS
!C     YHFHTS = NUMBER OF YEARS AT WHICH HALF THE INITIAL
!C              HEIGHT HAS BEEN LOST, FOR SOFT SNAGS
